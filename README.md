# PEAKReactBot

Make BingBong use ReactBot voicelines to replace their defaults with a much wider variety!

[ReactBot](https://jacksfilmscouncil-shop.fourthwall.com/products/reactbot-exe) courtesy of the Jackfilms Council.

[SoundAPI](https://soundapi.loaforc.me/) used to grab and replace sounds.

[PeakModding](https://peakmodding.github.io/) used for other modding purposes (currently just placeholder stuff, but may utilize if expanding this project beyond sound replacement).

## Manual Install Instructions

### PREREQUISITES

Ensure latest [BepinEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and [SoundAPI](github.com/loaforcsSoundAPI/loaforcsSoundAPI/releases) versions are installed locally (and that you ran the game once after setting up each. SoundAPI just needs its dll put under the plugins subfolder if you're pulling manually from github rather than ThunderStore).

### STEP 1

Unzip downloaded release of PEAKReactBot.

### STEP 2

Take the contents of the plugins folder (inluding replacers, sounds, sound_pack.json and the dll file) and move them into the plugins folder under BepinEx in your local game files.

### STEP 3

Launch the game, enter a local or online lobby, get to the island and interact with BingBong to hear the all new, widely expanded possible responses!

## Future TODOs

- Apply a crunchy filter to ReactBot lines to replicate the voicebox effect of the originals.
- Replace the on-screen text BingBong displays with accurate readouts of the new ReactBot lines.
- Replace BingBong's model with a digital recreation of the All New (tm) ReactBot plush!
